Day 1: <a href="http://www.spellyourfriends.com/">Spell Your Friends</a><br/>
</div>
<div class="main">
<p>My new year's resolution is to launch a new website everyday. I'm going to code up a bit of every idea I have laying around, everyday. It may be simple PHP or Rails app, or something more, but I predict 365 ripples will make a splash.
</p>
<p>I'm a programmer, and I often have many ideas for websites. I'm a big of the minimal viable product concept, and I know a lot can be done in a day. After reading 37signal's book Reworked, and thinking about the power of small successes, I decided why not come out something new everyday.</p>

<p>About a month and a half ago, I started swimming everday. I've recognized the power of consistent commitment. So, now I'm applying this to my web ideas, and will be releasing a new website, everyday, for all of 2011. I suspect some of these may great successes. Others may amount to nothing. Yet, 365 new web ideas is quite something./p>

<p>Consistency will be key to do so many things. Think of all the possibilites. I know not everything can be done in a day. I expect some of these things to go on to bigger and greater things. Others will probably wither in the great internet sphere.  </p>

<p>So, check back here, everday for the results of my progress. </p>
